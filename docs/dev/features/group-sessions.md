# Group sessions

A group session is held with the patients of **one patient list**. The flow differs from the
standard one in what comes first: the list, then the form, then who takes part.

1. **The list** (`GroupSessionListFragment`): the home card and the Group tab open it; the page of a
   list has **Start a group session**, which skips it (shown only for a downloaded list). It shows
   the lists of the chosen location (`atLocation`) that are **downloaded** (ticked on the Patient
   lists screen: the session is held with patients of the device) and asks the server once for
   new ones. One tap chooses the list.
2. **The form** (`CreateEncountersFragment`, argument `patient_list_id`): as for any encounter form,
   with the unfinished sessions to resume. A resume goes straight to the form (the draft knows its
   patients and its list: `GroupSessionDraft.patientListId`).
3. **Who takes part** (`GroupSessionPatientsFragment`, `GroupSessionPatientsViewModel`): the
   patients of the list, ticked; the user unticks the absent ones. A member the device does not
   have is greyed. The screen does not change the download. **Add patients** opens the list picker
   in session mode (`PatientListPickerFragment`, argument `session`): the patients of the device
   and, in live mode with a connection (`LiveSync.isAvailable`), those of the server found with 3
   letters. None is added to the list there; the chosen ones from the server are downloaded first
   (`LivePatients.download`, kept: the forms are filled in on this device; one that cannot be
   downloaded is left out and said so), and the ids come back through the saved state of the
   screen. In the picker, **Not in the list? Create a new patient** opens the registration
   (`AddPatientFragment`, argument `for_session`); once saved the patient comes back to the session
   (`popBackStack` to the session screen, the id in its saved state), ticked. **Identify later**
   records a placeholder patient (`UnidentifiedPatients.create`) and adds it to the session.
4. **Start** (`GroupSessionPatientsViewModel.begin`) adds the patients added to the session to the
   list (`patientsToJoinList`: those still ticked and not in the list already; one registered on
   the device and not uploaded is added **held for the upload**), then opens the form (`GroupFormEntryFragment`) with the ticked
   patients. Cancelling before Start leaves the list untouched.

The session details (the form's first step) cannot be skipped: with a required answer missing the
review offers "Fix questions" only (`allowSubmitAnyway = false` for the screener of
`GroupFormEntryFragment`; the patients' forms keep the library's default).

The record of the session names its list: each encounter carries the list's id and name as the two
internal observations (`GroupFormEntryViewModel.createInternalObservations`), read from the
patient lists of the device, so a list created on the device and not sent yet works too.

## The cohort observations

Every encounter of a session records the id and the name of the list as two observations the user never sees
(`GroupFormEntryViewModel.createInternalObservations`). Their concepts are in the app configuration
(`<group-sessions cohort-identifier-concept=... cohort-name-concept=...>`, `configuration.md`): a blank or absent
one is not recorded, and one the server was found not to have (`server-compatibility.md`) is skipped, since a
concept the server lacks makes it refuse the whole encounter. With a server that does not let patients be added
to a list, the patients added to a session take part in it only.

## Limits

* A patient registered on the device and not uploaded takes part at once and joins the list after
  the upload (`patient-list-management.md`); the screen says so.
* An added patient to identify joins the list for good only when identified
  (`patient-list-management.md`).
* Without live mode (or without a connection) the picker of a session offers the patients of the
  device only: the forms are filled in on this device.
